## Common Problems

### Invalid HDF5 file generated with I/O bit HDF5 Writer

Sometimes, the `libhdf5` and `VFD-GDS` installations can fall out of sync, leading to issues. If the HDF5 file generated by the I/O bit HDF5 Writer ends up invalid, check whether both installations are compatible by consulting their respective [documentation](https://github.com/hpc-io/vfd-gds). As a good practice, ensure that any previous installation is fully removed to avoid stale library objects lingering around. For reference, the following commits are known to work well together:
