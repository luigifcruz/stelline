# Validated Hardware

We purchased multiple servers and other peripherals to validate the Stelline in them. This section will cover each one of them and will provide details of what really works and what doesn’t. We hope this helps the community to choose a suitable server with less of the arduous trial and error process of validating a server.

Most modern consumer desktop, particularly those utilized for gaming, are most likely compatible with most of the hardware requirements, for example, PCIe resizable BAR. Although suitable for development purposes, they are not mentioned in this list because they often utilize CPUs without enough PCIe lanes to make sense for a production deployment.
